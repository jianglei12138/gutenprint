.SH NAME
escputil \- maintain Epson Stylus inkjet printers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B escputil
[ \fI\-P\fP \fIprinter\fP | \fI\-r\fP \fIdevice\fP ] [ \fI\-m\fP \fImodel\fP ] [
\fI\-u\fP ] [ \fI\-c\fP | \fI\-n\fP | \fI\-a\fP | \fI\-i\fP | \fI\-d\fP |
\fI\-o\fP | \fI\-s\fP | \fI\-l\fP | \fI\-M\fP | \fI\-h\fP ] [ \fI\-q\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBescputil\fP is a command line utility to perform various maintenance tasks
on Epson Stylus inkjet printers.  These tasks include head alignment, head
cleaning, nozzle check, printer identification, and retrieval of ink level from
the printer.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBescputil\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-printer\-name=\fIprinter\fP
Specify the name of the printer to operate on.  The default is the default
system printer.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-raw\-device=\fIdevice\fP
Specify the name of the device to write to directly rather than going through a
printer queue. You must use this (rather than specifying a printer) when
retrieving ink levels or identifying the printer, or if you wish to perform
head alignment without specifying the printer model.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-model=\fImodel\fP
Specify the precise printer model for head alignment.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-new
The printer is a new printer (Stylus Color 740 or newer).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clean\-head
Clean the print head.  This can also be performed from the printer
front panel.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nozzle\-check
Print a nozzle test pattern.  Dirty or clogged nozzles will show as gaps in the
pattern.  If you see any gaps, you should run a head cleaning pass or two.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-align\-head
Align the print head.  CAUTION: Misuse of this option may result in poor print
quality and/or damage to the printer.  You must either specify the printer
model with the \-m option, or use the raw printer device to allow escputil to
detect the printer model.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ink\-level
Obtain the ink level from the printer.  This requires
read/write access to the raw printer device.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-identify
Query the printer for make and model information.
This requires read/write access to the raw printer
device.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-align\-color
Align the color print head (used by Stylus Color 480 and 580 only).  CAUTION:
Misuse of this option may result in poor print quality and/or damage to the
printer.   
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-status
Retrieve printer status.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-license
Display the license/warranty terms of this program.
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-list\-models
List the supported printer models.
.TP
.B  \-h, \-\-help
Display a list of all command line options.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress the banner.
.SH BUGS
USB-connected printers sometimes fail to identify or return ink levels.  You
may have to repeat the command.  This is probably a timing issue in escputil,
not a flaw in the printer.
.PP
Anything requiring bidirectional communication with the printer (identify, ink
levels, or head alignment without specifying the printer model) requires
read/write access to the printer port (for example /dev/lp0).  This may require
these operations to be performed as root.  In addition, kernel support is
required for bidirectional communication.  For Linux version 2.2,
\fICONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK\fP should be enabled; this is called
\fICONFIG_PARPORT_1284\fP on 2.4 and later kernels.
.PP
If the printer is performing self-test or head cleaning on power up, the
identify and ink level commands will time out, although the printer
successfully receives the command.  The command will need to be reissued when
the printer is quiescent.
