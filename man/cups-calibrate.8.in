.TH CUPS\-CALIBRATE "8" "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GUTENPRINT_VERSION@" "Gutenprint Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
cups\-calibrate \- ESP CUPS Printer Calibration Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cups\-calibrate
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program allows you to calibrate the color output of printers using the
\fBGutenprint\fR \fICUPS\fR or \fIESP Print Pro\fR drivers.
.PP
Please note that this program \fBonly\fP works with the \fBGutenprint\fR
\fICUPS\fR or \fIESP Print Pro\fR drivers. If you are using the Gutenprint
\fIstp\fR or \fIijsgimmprint\fR driver for GhostScript or the drivers for the
Gutenprint Print plug-in for \fIThe GIMP\fR, the calibration will not work.
.PP
These drivers are identified by the text \fICUPS+Gutenprint\fR or \fIESP Print
Pro\fR in the model description displayed by the CUPS web interface, KUPS, the
ESP Print Pro Printer Manager, or printerdrake.
.PP
To make a calibration profile for all users, run this program as
the \fBroot\fR user.  The program displays a series of prompts which should
simply be followed.
