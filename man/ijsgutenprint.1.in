.TH IJSGUTENPRINT 1 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GUTENPRINT_VERSION@" "Gutenprint Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
ijsgutenprint \- Ghostscript driver for Gutenprint
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gs
\-sDEVICE=ijs
\-sIjsServer=@prefix@/bin/ijsgutenprint
\-sDeviceManufacturer=\fIvendor\fP
\-sDeviceModel=\fIname\fP
[ \fI\-dIjsUseOutputFD\fP ]
\-sIjsParams=[ \fIkey1\fP=\fIvalue1\fP,\fIkeyn\fP=\fIvaluen\fP... ]
[ \fIoptions\fP ]
[ \fIfiles\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ijsgutenprint
provides Ghostscript with a Gutenprint driver, supporting all printers
supported by libgutenprint.
.PP
.B NOTE:
ijsgutenprint should never be called directly.  Ghostscript will run it if the
IjsServer parameter is set to IjsServer=ijsgutenprint when invoking the IJS
driver.
.PP
.B NOTE:
The only \fIsupported\fP method of running ijsgutenprint is via Foomatic.
Users running ghostscript directly will not be supported.  The driver name used
by Foomatic is \fIgutenprint\-ijs.@GUTENPRINT_MAJOR_VERSION@.@GUTENPRINT_MINOR_VERSION@\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIijsgutenprint\fP accepts the following Ghostscript IJS options.  The
Gutenprint-specific options are not documented here.
.TP
.B \-dIjsUseOutputFD
This option should be specified whenever output from Ghostscript will go to
stdout or into a pipe.  It may be specified in all other cases, with only a
slight performance degradation.
.TP
\fB\-sIjsParams\fP=\fIOption1\fP=\fIValue1\fP,\fIOption2\fP=\fIValue2\fP
This parameter contains a single string containing a comma-separated list of
sub-options.
.TP
\fB\-sDeviceManufacturer\fP=\fIvendor\fP \fB\-sDeviceModel\fP=\fIname\fP
This option must be supplied.  There is no default.  The IJS driver requires
the \fIvendor\fP (it's part of the protocol), but the ijsgutenprint driver
ignores it.
.SH HISTORY
The Ghostscript \fBstp\fP driver was originally written by Henryk Richter
(buggs@comlab.uni\-rostock.de), and was integrated into Gutenprint during the
3.1 development series.  Gutenprint (which was named Gimp-Print prior to
release 5.0) itself was originally written by Michael Sweet <mike@easysw.com>,
who released up to version 2.0; Robert Krawitz released version 3.0.  The
Gutenprint development team (http://gimp\-print.sourceforge.net) now maintains
the entire package.
.PP
The IJS driver was originally written by Russell Lang, and incorporated into
Gutenprint (known then as Gimp-Print) in early 2002.  This driver corresponds
with the IJS protocol 0.32.
.PP
The \fBstp\fP driver is no longer supported as of Gutenprint 5.0.
