.TH CUPS\-GENPPDUPDATE "8" "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GUTENPRINT_VERSION@" "Gutenprint Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
cups\-genppdupdate \- update CUPS+Gutenprint PPD files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cups\-genppdupdate
[\fI\-h\fP]
[\fI\-n\fP]
[\fI\-N\fP]
[\fI\-q\fP | \fI\-v\fP]
[\fI\-s ppd-directory\fP]
[\fI\-s output-directory\fP]
[\fIPPD-FILES or QUEUES...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcups\-genppdupdate\fP regenerates the \fIGutenprint\fP PPD files in use by
CUPS, using the PPD files under \fI@cups_conf_datadir@/model/gutenprint\fP as
templates.  The new PPD file replaces the old PPD file under
\fI@cups_conf_serverroot@/ppd\fP, but all the options set in the old PPD will
be merged into the new PPD, provided that they are still valid in the new file.
.PP
If no files or queue names are specified, \fBcups\-genppdupdate\fP updates all
Gutenprint PPD files in \fI@cups_conf_serverroot@/ppd\fP.  Otherwise,
\fBcups\-genppdupdate\fP updates all files or queues listed on the command
line.
.PP
\fBcups\-genppdupdate\fP does not update Foomatic PPD files or PPD files from
Gimp-Print 4.2 or earlier.
.PP
\fBcups\-genppdupdate\fP does \fBnot\fP restart cupsd.  cupsd will need
manually reloading (or send SIGHUP) once \fBcups\-genppdupdate\fP has
completed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show a help message.
.TP
.B \-n
No action.  The program will run, but the old PPD files will not be replaced.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.  No messages will be issued, apart from errors.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  More informative messages will be issued.  Note that extremely
verbose output may be turned on by setting $debug=1 in the source, but this
output will not be of use to the average user.
.TP
.B \-s \fIppd-directory\fP
Use \fIppd-directory\fP as the base directory to read PPD files from.  By
default, the base directory is \fP@cups_conf_datadir@/model/gutenprint\fP.
Under this directory, the PPD files are located in subdirectories according to
language code and territory.
.TP
.B \-o \fIoutput-directory\fP
Place updated PPD files in \fIoutput-directory\fP.  By default, this is the
same as the input directory.
.TP
.B \-N
Reset all options to their defaults (do not merge options from the current PPD
file)
