>; this means that everyone
    is free to use it and free to redistribute it on a free basis.
    Gutenprint is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and
    there are restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions
    are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen
    would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others
    from further sharing any version of Gutenprint that they might get
    from you.
  </P

>&#13;    Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
    away copies of Gutenprint, that you receive source code or else
    can get it if you want it, that you can change Gutenprint or use
    pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
    these things.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you
    to deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you
    distribute copies of Gutenprint, you must give the recipients all
    the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too,
    receive or can get the source code, and you must tell them their
    rights.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
    finds out that there is no warranty for Gutenprint.  If Gutenprint
    is modified by someone else and passed on, we want their
    recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed,
    so that any problems introduced by others will no reflect on our
    reputation.
