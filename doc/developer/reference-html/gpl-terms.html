>&#13;	This License applies to any program or other work which

	be distributed under the terms of this General Public
	License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
	work, and a <SPAN

	either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
	that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of
	it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
	into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included

	the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
	constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
	been made by running the Program). Whether that is true
	depends on what the Program does.

	satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
	any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
	not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
	Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
	through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
	this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of

	distribute software through any other system and a licensee
