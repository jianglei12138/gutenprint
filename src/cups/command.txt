command.txt - 09/10/2000 - CUPS Drivers
---------------------------------------

This file describes the experimental CUPS command file format,
used to send printer commands to a printer in a device-
independent way.


FILE FORMAT INFORMATION

CUPS command files are ASCII text files.  The first line of a
CUPS command file MUST contain:

    #CUPS-COMMAND

After that, each line is either a command or a comment.
Comments begin with the # character, e.g.:

    # This is a comment

The printer commands are described below.  Printer commands are
case- insensitive, so "PRINTSELFTESTPAGE", "printselftestpage",
and "PrintSelfTestPage" are equivalent.  Commands that accept
arguments have their arguments on the same line separated by
spaces.


PRINTER COMMANDS

The following commands are currently recognized:

    Clean all
    Clean black
    Clean color
    Clean cyan
    Clean light-cyan
    Clean light-magenta
    Clean magenta
    Clean yellow

	Do a standard print head cleaning.  If a printer does
	not support cleaning of individual colors or cartridges,
	then all print heads are cleaned.

    PrintAlignmentPage phase

	Print an alignment page on the printer.  Typically this
	page shows the horizontal and vertical alignment of the
	print heads with numbers for each.  The phase number can
	be omitted.

    PrintSelfTestPage

	Print a self-test page on the printer.  Typically this
	page shows if all jets on a print head are functioning
	properly.

    ReportLevels

	Reports the levels of each marking color in the
	printer-state-message attribute.  The format of the
	report string is one of:

            K=###
	    C=### M=### Y=###
	    K=### C=### M=### Y=###
	    K=### C=### M=### Y=### LC=### LM=###

	depending on the marking colors available.

    SetAlignment phase x y

	Sets the alignment of the print heads in the X and Y
	directions. The phase number must match that specified
	by the PrintAlignmentPage command or be 0.  The Y
	direction is not used by some printers.
